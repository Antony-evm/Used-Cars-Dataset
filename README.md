## Used Cars

The "Used Cars" dataset is a combination of information from autotrader.com and carfax.com, 
containing details on approximately 52 used cars,
including their brand, model, year, mileage, city and highway mileage,
horsepower, torque, engine capacity, fuel capacity, number of cylinders, number of seats, number of owners,
price, link, condition, type, number of doors, wheel drive, engine type, speed levels, front headroom, front legroom, rear headroom,
rear legroom, and service records.

In this project, we will conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and identify any correlations between variables.
We will also build several machine learning models to predict the sale price of the used cars,
using techniques such as logistic regression, ridge regression, XGBoost, and GBM. 
Finally, we will create an ensemble model that combines the predictions of the previous models.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and use the insights gained to improve your models. 
You'll also learn best practices for creating effective data feeds and building an ensemble model. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or feedback.
